      <h2>
        How We Protect Your Personal information
      </h2>
      <p>
        In order to protect your security, we use the strongest available browser encryption and store all of our data on servers in secure facilities in the UK & EU. All data is only accessible to our employees or partners if approved by you. Our employees are bound by strict confidentiality agreements and a breach of this agreement would result in the employee's termination.
      </p>

      <p>
        While we take all reasonable precautions to ensure that user data is secure and that users are protected, there always remains the risk of harm. The Internet as a whole can be insecure at times and therefore we are unable to guarantee the security of user data beyond what is reasonably practical.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Cookies and Web Beacons
      </h2>
      <p>
        Like any other website, Mast uses 'cookies'. These cookies are used to store information including visitors' preferences, and the pages on the website that the visitor accessed or visited. The information is used to optimise the users' experience by customising our web page content based on visitors' browser type and/or other information.
      </p>

      <p>

The information collected by log files include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date and time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. These are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable. The purpose of the information is for analysing trends, administering the site, tracking users' movement on the website, and gathering demographic information.
