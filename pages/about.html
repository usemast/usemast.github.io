              It's an open secret that the mortgage journey is painful and slow for many people in the UK. Some borrowers have to wait over 60 days for a decision on their mortgage application.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              With the right technology, we can improve the experience for everyone involved. For brokers, we can make lenders easier and simpler to do business with. For lenders, we can help smooth operations and get the right information into the hands of those who need it faster. And for the customer, their clunky stressful applications can be made a thing of the past.
