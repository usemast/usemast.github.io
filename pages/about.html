            <p class="lead">It's an open secret that the mortgage journey is broken and outdated. Many people in the UK have to wait over 60 days to get a decision on their mortgage application.

            <p class="lead">
              With the right technology, we can get mortgage applications to lenders in the best possible shape – without missing documents, bad data or policy violations – so that lenders can make a decision faster. Lenders will process more loans, intermediaries will have more time to focus on building relationships with their clients, and most importantly customers will have a much better experience during the biggest financial decision of their lives.

            </div>

            <p class="lead mb-0">We're a venture-backed team of technologists, finance experts (and doughnut lovers). With over 25 years of combined experience, we're tackling the huge mission of making lending better.</p>

            <p class="lead">We are a principles-first company. No matter the circumstances, our principles are our north star. They guide us to become the best we can be and help us make decisions today to get us one step closer to our mission.</p>

            <p class="lead"><strong>People</strong>: Customers or employees, people always come first. People build technology to serve people. We are at the service of people, always.</p>
            <p class="lead"><strong>Integrity</strong>: Always do what is right and what is best for everyone.</p>
            <p class="lead"><strong>Candid Feedback</strong>: Giving and receiving feedback well is the one of the most important traits to learning. At Mast, anyone can voice their opinion, criticise ideas and call us out when we don't do things well, with the aim of assisting.</p>
            <p class="lead"><strong>Self awareness</strong>: We are all humans, we are all flawed and none of us know everything – and that should never be a limiting factor. It's okay to make mistakes, as long as you are happy to ask for help and want to learn. We succeed as a team.</p>
            <p class="lead"><strong>Reliability</strong>: We invest heavily in infrastructure, design and great service. Trust and reputation is a pillar of our identity.</p>
            <p class="lead"><strong>Honesty and transparency</strong>: We provide a safe and open environment. We rely on truthful and transparent communication to ensure that the best ideas win.</p>
            <p class="lead"><strong>Pursuit of excellence</strong>: Everything we do, we do well or we don’t do at all. Even the things that we don’t see at the surface. Excellence is in the process and in the details. The rest will take care of itself.</p>
