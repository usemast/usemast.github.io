              Founded in 2020, our mission is to use technology to empower mortgage lenders to focus on what they do best: lending. An oligopoly of technology suppliers provide a handful of systems that are outdated, infrequently updated and painful to customise.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              <strong>Mast is building cloud-native mortgage technology to help lenders process more mortgage applications in less time.</strong> We want to help lenders get to a mortgage decision much faster and much more efficiently, transforming the buying journey for the consumer.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              We are building self-service products that give lenders total control so they can offer the best service possible. We strongly believe that solving and addressing the hard problems at their roots is the only way to transform an industry.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              At Mast, we strive to create a <strong>fast-paced, fun and supportive working environment</strong> to enable our team to build the best products in the industry.
